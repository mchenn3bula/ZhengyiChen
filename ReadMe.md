# Utilization of Data Mining
In this document, I discuss two articles that demonstrate the utilzation of data mining.

## Application of Data Mining in the Analysis of Martial Arts Athlete Competition Skills and Tactics
In Lingrong Tao's research article [_Application of Data Mining in the Analysis of Martial Arts Athlete Competition Skills and Tactics_](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jhe/2021/5574152/), he discusses that data mining technologies are used to describe and analyze the moves of athletes and changes in the process and sequences. Data mining helps analysts to find the law of change to solve some problems for martial arts athletes in daily training to develop technology and tactics and improve competition results. 

Data mining is imperative in motorsports as well like formula 1, in which teams need to collect weather and aerodynamic data on the race track to calculate the optimized configuration for race cars on different race tracks.

## Artificial intelligence and data mining are being used to measure aerodynamic flows

In [_Artificial intelligence and data mining are being used to measure aerodynamic flows_](https://phys.org/news2021-06-artificial-intelligence-aerodynamic.html) by Carlos III University of Madrid, the author discusses methods of measuring turbulent flows using data mining and artificial intelliegence by conducting a research called "NEXTFLOW". The research team uses volumetric particle image velocimetry, which allow the team to obtain a 3D reconstruction of the movement fluid following the motion of particles, and made visible by a laser light. Researchers hope to use data provided by high sampling-frequency point probes to complement the 3D description with dynamics in time.

In addition to this, the team develops algorithms based on artificial intelligence to improve the accuracy of particle image velocimetry technique. With these methods, the team hope to define compact models that can be used to describe the behavior of flows accurately and develop control logics.
